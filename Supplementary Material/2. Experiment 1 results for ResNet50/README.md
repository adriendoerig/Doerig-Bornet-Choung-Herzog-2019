# 2. Experiment 1 results for ResNet50


In experiment 1b, we decoded vernier offset direction from 18 layers of ResNet50 (an early after the third convolution in the first "bottleneck", and after each "bottleneck" unit, see He et al. 2016), for a variety of flanker types. Below are the results for decoding performance on each layer. The following plots are presented as in figure 3.

Files show the same plot as panel c in figure 3
