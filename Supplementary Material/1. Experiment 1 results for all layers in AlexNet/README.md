# 1. Experiment 1 results for all layers in AlexNet


In experiment 1a, we decoded vernier offset direction from all layers of AlexNet (2012), for a variety of flanker types. Below are the results for decoding performance on each layer. The following plots are presented as in figure 3.

Files A_* show the same plot as panel a in figure 3
Files B_* show the same plot as panel b in figure 3
